But never let overthinking stop you from doing actual work. It’s easy to get stuck in considerations about the best approach to the problem, but to achieve something, you need to get your hands dirty.
	At first, you don’t need to make your code perfect. You need to create any code that resembles the final solution. Don’t be afraid of failure. Assume you’ll fail at first. Done is better than perfect — at least for now.
	Write your first draft as fast as possible. Maybe it won’t be any good, but you’ll explore some options and check if your approach is viable at all. Fast feedback is the best feedback. If your method failed, try another one. If the code works, you can build from there.
	Thinking in drafts takes the pressure off. You know that this is the first of many attempts, so your expectations regarding the quality are lower and you can start rapidly. The faster you start, the quicker you’ll progress. Create drafts until your code works. Now is the time for ruthless editing.</p>
